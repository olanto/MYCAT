The length of the shaft (2) is of the order of 1-1.5 m, and is executed at a point approximately half way along its length with a bend (6), so that the part (2a) of the shaft (2) between the handle (4) and the bend (6) forms an angle (v2) with the part (2b) of the shaft (2) situated between the bend (6) and the tool attachment.
